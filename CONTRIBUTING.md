# How to contribute

## Add features or fix bugs

- Find an open, unassigned issue or submit a new one.
- If submitting a new feature request, best discuss the idea before starting to implement it.
- If an issue is assigned, it usually means that I will implement this task myself.
- When in doubt, it's always best to start a conversation before putting in work.
- Respect the EditorConfig formatting and style settings. If you discover inconsistencies or missing guidelines, feel free to add and discuss them.

## Test and report issues

The main challenges with this project:
- Heavy use of platform-specific file paths and implementation details.
- Changing Unity Hub and Editor APIs or conventions.
